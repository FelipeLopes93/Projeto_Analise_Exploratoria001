# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing my portfolio of data science projects, completed and under development, carried out by me for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes.
In this repository I will present projects using IPython Notebook, R Markdown, Power BI and Databases.

# Contains the following project categories:

  <i> •	Insights Projects:</i> Starting from a business problem, the objective of the projects is to recommend solutions for the business through Insights generated by a great Exploratory Data Analysis.

  <i> •	Machine Learning Projects:</i> Machine Learning projects aim to create business solutions using one or more Machine Learning algorithms.

  <i> •	Data Engineering Projects:</i> As a Data Scientist in some cases we will need to be independent in order to be able to collect the data necessary to perform our analyzes. Thus, projects in this category aim to collect and organize data. With the data in hand, we will present some DashBoards for better visualization of the data.

  <i> •	Solutions in Dashboads:</i> Dashboards with the objective of presenting data in dynamic ways, from simple information to the most elaborate.
